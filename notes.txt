Certainly! Here are a few C# parser generator tools that can be used to create parsers based on input grammars:

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition)

Language: C# support
ANTLR is a powerful parser generator that supports multiple languages. It's widely used for building parsers and translators.
Irony

Language: C#
Irony is an implementation of a simple modern parser generator that you can use to create parsers using grammars defined in C#.
GoldParser

Language: C#
GoldParser is a simple, yet powerful, parser generator that supports various programming languages including C#. It allows you to define grammars and generate parsers accordingly.
PEG.js (Parsing Expression Grammar for JavaScript)

Language: C# via translation or adaptation
While PEG.js itself is for JavaScript, its grammar definitions can be translated or adapted to C# for use in building parsers.
Sprache

Language: C#
Sprache is a simple, lightweight library for constructing parsers directly in C# code. It allows you to define grammars using C# methods and functions.
Each of these tools has its strengths and unique features. Depending on your specific requirements and the complexity of the grammars, you might find one more suitable than others.
